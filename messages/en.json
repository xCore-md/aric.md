Online payment is made under maximum security conditions using the payment card as an instrument that allows online transactions. After payment you will receive a payment confirmation at your email address. The payment processor uses a secure system based on the latest version of the 3D-Secure security standard, which means a new global approach to authenticating buyers in secure online transactions. This safety measure involves redirecting the user at the moment of payment to a secure maib page where each cardholder is authenticated by assigning a one-time code for each online transaction. Refunds are made only to the payment card used for purchase. To make a payment, you will need to enter your card details. The transfer of this information is carried out in accordance with all necessary security measures. The information is transmitted in encrypted form and stored only on a specialized server of the payment system. To process the payment the following data will be requested: Card number (16 digits) Expiration date (month and year) CVC or CVV code (3 digits) Name and surname on the card. If the currency of the card differs from the transaction currency (MDL), the conditions of the issuing bank will apply when converting the amount withdrawn from the card account."
